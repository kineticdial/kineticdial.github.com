<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>
  I believe that small interfaces, immutable data, and idempotent
  systems make for the most robust software. As a software engineer
  with a passion for data and site reliability, I have a proven track
  record of shipping and monitoring services and creating tools and
  dashboards for on-call engineers.

  You know that app that is a nightmare to deploy? It doesn't have to
  be that way.
